      <h2>Sea Freight (FCL / LCL)</h2>
      <p>
        ProShip Star Logistics provides cost-effective Sea Freight solutions
        for both Full Container Load (FCL) and Less than Container Load (LCL)
        shipments, connecting major ports across the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        For FCL cargo, we offer dedicated containers with flexible schedules,
        reliable transit times, and complete visibility from origin to
        destination. For LCL, our consolidation services allow you to ship
        smaller volumes while still benefiting from attractive ocean rates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team coordinates booking, documentation, customs interface, and
        final delivery, ensuring your ocean cargo moves smoothly and safely
        with minimal delays.
